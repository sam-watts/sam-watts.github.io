    1: "Quite challenging for a day 1! Learned some new regex for part 2 which was fun - positive lookahead `?=...` essentially means you can extract overlapping matches",
    2: "Feel like this should have been day one 😄",
    3: "I don't like grids 🫠 I probably made this harder than it needed to be. If I were to do this again I probably would have just used euclidian distance comparisons",
    4: "Enjoyed the logic for the second part with the copies. I'm sure there was potential to go on a wild goose chase with recursion here, so I'm happy to have avoided the temptation 🤣",
    5: "Stuck on part 2 for now...",
    6: "There's definitely a more efficient way of doing part 2, but good enough :)",
    7: "Had a solution that I thought made sense but didn't give the right answer. Went to reddit for inspiration!",
    8: "Tried to do part 2 a silly way at first - I didn't realise that all z visits happen on the same cycle for a given starting point!",

Learned about Lagrangian Interpolation which was ...fun? In a slightly-too-small-nutshell, we
can construct a summation of polynomials, where each term goes to zero when
its corresponding x value is inputted to the function. Each term will be in
the form:

$$
\frac{\text{diff}_n}{n!}\prod_{i=1}^{n}(x - i)
$$

Where $n$ is the order of the term (constant, x, x^2 etc.) and $\text{diff}_n$ is the
difference at the correct level in the sequence of inputs. The differencing
table is essentially what is constructed in the puzzle explanation. From this
table, we take the first column of values to use as $diff$.
